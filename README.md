# HUMANZ NFT

Using PatrickAlphaC's tutorial on creating an NFT project I adapted a few more things into it.

- Expanded the NFT image to include an generative art pixelated face, the random numbers are all generated on chain using Chainlink VRF, expanded into multiple random numbers and used to select the features of the Humanz with a similar rarity.

- Programmatically Pinning IPFS links with Pinata calling it's API. Usefull for when my IPFS node goes down
